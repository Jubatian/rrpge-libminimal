Overall architecture for 00.006.000


DMA peripherals work at the same level like the CPU, they can simply be fired
like the Mixer now, from the address generator.

From the graphics only the rrpge_m_grln() function will remain rendering the
current line. This part may be left alone until finalizing 00.007.000, thus
skipping 00.006.000 altogether for this part.


Graphics FIFO:

The info structure's arq member changes. It would contain FIFO trigger (name
may change to frq). It may be set in the addressing unit when the FIFO should
be started (either writing the FIFO start trigger, or a command with the
accelerator's address, the latter may be done in the FIFO's routines).
