Overall architecture for 00.006.000


Simplify. All randomizing quirks will be removed, cleaning up especially the
graphics.

At the CPU side, always attempt to render to the end of the current graphics
line, position of HBlank is irrelevant.

The Graphics FIFO does not need to follow the CPU that strict like now since
it is mostly intended to perform large bulk operations anyway (no need to
terminate roughly cycle exact like now with the Accelerator alone).

The method for both the Display and the Graphics FIFO & related is to follow
the CPU, doing any necessary renders as needed to catch up.

DMA peripherals work at the same level like the CPU, they can simply be fired
like the Mixer now, from the address generator.


From the graphics only the rrpge_m_grln() function will remain rendering the
current line. This part may be left alone until finalizing 00.007.000, thus
skipping 00.006.000 altogether for this part.
