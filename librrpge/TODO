Specs:

(!!! Reworking the inputs. Now I put it away for a bit later, first test,
but needs to be done before releasing !!!)

(!!! ROPD change: User data is no longer included, so for one, it has no
place in the ROPD interface of the RRPGE library, for other, it has to be
serviced by the host !!!)



Missing parts:

Arbitrary file load & file save.

Application header - license & RRPGE specification check.

rrpge_db.h (Debug functions)
rrpge_pr.h (Library properties)



Library interface:


Kernel functions should have a proper external resolver. That is a possibility
to request all parameters, and another to inject back a return value,
preferably something nicer than telling to stuff it in C:A. This interface
could work for the arbitrary file load & save as well.



Audio stuff needs randomization later (to prevent relying on undefined
behavior).
