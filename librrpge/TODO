Working on implementing specification 00.010.000.

Need to fix initial data memory problem (see rrpge_init in rgm_main()).

For now, the state attach and detach features are left in a not quite
functional state. This part of the interface needs some additional tought
(when to reset the emulator, how it should proceed after a state load, how it
should replace the app. header if requested by no compatibility check).

Missing parts (otherwise):

Application header - RRPGE specification check.

rrpge_db.h (Debug functions)
rrpge_pr.h (Library properties, this may even need to be revised)
